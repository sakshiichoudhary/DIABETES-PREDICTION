# DIABETES-PREDICTION

Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way the body processes blood sugar, 
Diabetic Prediction Project is a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether a patient has diabetes or not ,and 
can lead to a variety of health problems if left untreated. The project uses a dataset of patient health metrics, such as glucose level, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI),The project includes a Jupyter notebook that walks through the process of loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, training machine learning models, and evaluating the performance of the models.SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm plays a crucial role in the Diabetic Prediction Project as it is used for classification of patients into diabetic and non-diabetic groups based on their medical data.Therefore, the SVM algorithm is an important tool in the Diabetic Prediction Project for accurate prediction of diabetic patients, leading to timely diagnosis and treatment.

The performance of the Diabetic Prediction model was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. The average accuracy of the model was found to be 78%, which indicates that the model can correctly predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes in 78% of cases.

Usage:
To use the Diabetic Prediction model, the user can input the required features (age, BMI, blood pressure, etc.) into the model, and the model will output a prediction of the likelihood of the individual having diabetes. The model can be integrated into a web application or mobile app to provide easy access for medical professionals and patients.

Support Vector Machine is a powerful machine learning algorithm that can be used for diabetic prediction. 
SVM can achieve high accuracy and can be used to identify individuals at high risk of developing diabetes. 
The SVM model can be integrated into various applications to provide easy access for medical professionals and patients.
The SVM model can be integrated into various applications such as mobile apps and web applications to facilitate easy access for medical professionals and patients.
